  <h2>Essential Grammar</h2>

  <p>
    We have learned the basic foundation of the Japanese language.
    we can now extend that by learning specific grammar for various situations. This section will go over what is
    considered to be essential grammar for basic practical Japanese.
    You will begin to see fewer literal translations in order to emphasize the new grammar now that you (should) have a
    good understanding of the basic fundamental grammar.

    <h2>The Question Marker （か）</h2>

    <h3>Questions in polite form</h3>
    <h3>Vocabulary</h3>
    <p>
      1. ⽥中【た・なか】- Tanaka (last name) <br>
      2. お⺟さん【お・かあ・さん】- mother (polite) <br>
      3. どこ- where <br>
      4. 鈴⽊【すず・き】- Suzuki (last name) <br>
      5. ⺟【はは】- mother <br>
      6. 買い物【か・い・もの】- shopping <br>
      7. ⾏く【い・く】- to go <br>
      8. イタリア- Italy <br>
      9. 料理【りょう・り】- cooking, cuisine, dish <br>
      10. ⾷べる【た・べる】- to eat <br>
      11. すみません- sorry (polite) <br>
      12. ちょっと- a little <br>
      13. お腹【お・なか】- stomach <br>
      14. いっぱい- full <br>
      15. ごめんなさい- sorry (polite) <br>
      16. ごめん- sorry <br>
    </p>

    <p>
      The question marker is covered here because it is primarily used to clearly indicate a question in polite
      sentences. While it is entirely possible to express a question even in polite form using just intonation, the
      question marker is often attached to the very end of the sentence to indicate a question. The question
      marker is simply the hiragana character「か」and you don't need to add a question mark. For previously
      explained reasons, you must not use the declarative 「だ」with the question marker.
    </p>

    <h3>Example 1</h3>
    <p>
      ⽥中さん：お⺟さんはどこですか。 <br>
      Tanaka-san: Where is (your) mother? <br>
      鈴⽊さん：⺟は買い物に⾏きました。 <br>
      Suzuki-san: (My) mother went shopping.
    </p>

    <h3>Example 2</h3>

    <p>
      キムさん：イタリア料理を⾷べに⾏きませんか。 <br>
      Kim-san: Go to eat Italian food? <br> <br>

      鈴⽊さん：すみません。ちょっと、お腹がいっぱいです。 <br>
      Suzuki-san: Sorry. (My) stomach is a little full.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the question is actually being used as an invitation just like how in English we say, "Won't you come
      in for a drink?" 「すみません」is a polite way of apologizing. Slightly less formal is 「ごめんなさい」
      while the casual version is simply 「ごめん」.
    </p>

    <h3>Vocabulary</h3>
    <p>
      1. こんな- this sort of <br>
      2. 本当【ほん・とう】- real <br>
      3. ⾷べる【た・べる】- to eat <br>
      4. そんな- that sort of <br>
      5. ある - to exist (inanimate)
    </p>

    <p>
      It makes sense to conclude that the question marker would work in exactly the same way in casual speech
      as it does in polite speech. However, this is not the case. The question marker 「か」is usually not
      used with casual speech to make actual questions. It is often used to consider whether something is
      true or not. Depending on the context and intonation, it can also be used to make rhetorical questions
      or to express sarcasm. It can sound quite rough so you might want to be careful about using 「か」for
      questions in the plain casual form.
    </p>

    <h3>Examples</h3>

    <p>
      1. こんなのを本当に⾷べるか？ <br>
      Do you think [he/she] will really eat this type of thing? <br> <br>

      2. そんなのは、あるかよ！ <br>
      Do I look like I would have something like that?!
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead of 「か」, real questions in casual speech are usually asked with the explanatory のparticle or
      nothing at all except for a rise in intonation, as we have already seen in previous sections.
    </p>

    <p>
      1. こんなのを本当に⾷べる？ <br>
      Are you really going to eat something like this? <br> <br>

      2. そんなのは、あるの？ <br>
      Do you have something like that?
    </p>

    <h2>「か」used in relative clauses</h2>

    <h3>Vocabulary</h3>

    <p>
      1. 昨⽇【きのう】- yesterday <br>
      2. 何【なに】- what <br>
      3. ⾷べる【た・べる】- to eat <br>
      4. 忘れる【わす・れる】- to forget <br>
      5. 彼【かれ】- he; boyfriend <br>
      6. ⾔う【い・う】- to say <br>
      7. 分かる【わ・かる】- to understand <br>
      8. 先⽣【せん・せい】- teacher <br>
      9. 学校【がっ・こう】- school <br>
      10. ⾏く【い・く】- to go <br>
      11. 教える【おし・える】- to teach; to inform <br>
      12. どう- how <br>
      13. 知る【し・る】- to know
    </p>

    <p>
      Another use of the question marker is simply grammatical and has nothing to do with the politeness. A
      question marker attached to the end of a relative clause makes a mini-question inside a larger sentence.
      This allows the speaker to talk about the question. For example, you can talk about the question, "What
      did I eat today?" In the following examples, the question that is being considered is in red.
    </p>

    <p>
      1. 昨⽇何を⾷べたか忘れた。 <br>
      Forgot what I ate yesterday. <br> <br>

      2. 彼は何を⾔ったか分からない。 <br>
      Don't understand what he said. <br> <br>

      3. 先⽣が学校に⾏ったか教えない？ <br>
      Won't you inform me whether teacher went to school?
    </p>

    <p>
      In sentences like example 3 where the question being considered has a yes/no answer, it is common (but
      not necessary) to attach 「どうか」. This is roughly equivalent to saying, "whether or not" in English.
      You can also include the alternative as well to mean the same thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      1. 先⽣が学校に⾏ったかどうか知らない。 <br>
      Don't know whether or not teacher went to school. <br> <br>

      2. 先⽣が学校に⾏ったか⾏かなかったか知らない。 <br>
      Don't know whether teacher went to school or didn't.
    </p>

    </p>

    <p>
      While we're on the topic of questions, this is a good time to go over question words (where, who, what,
      etc.) and what they mean in various contexts. Take a look at what adding the question marker does to
      the meaning of the words.
    </p>

    <h3>Question Words</h3>

    <p>
      誰か - Someone <br>
      何か - Something <br>
      いつか - Sometime <br>
      どこか - Somewhere <br>
      どれか - A certain one from many
    </p>

    <h3>Examples</h3>

    <p>
      As you can see by the following examples, you can treat these words just like any regular nouns.
    </p>

    <p>
      1. 誰かがおいしいクッキーを全部⾷べた。 <br>
      Someone ate all the delicious cookies. <br> <br>

      2. 誰が盗んだのか、誰か知りませんか。 <br>
      Doesn't anybody know who stole it? <br> <br>

      3. 犯⼈をどこかで⾒ましたか。 <br>
      Did you see the criminal somewhere? <br> <br>

      4. この中からどれかを選ぶの。 <br>
      (Explaining) You are to select a certain one from inside this (selection).
    </p>

    <p>
      The same question words in the chart above can be combined with 「も」in a negative sentence to
      mean "nobody" (誰も), "nothing" (何も), "nowhere" (どこも), etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      「誰も」and 「何も」are primarily used only for negative sentences. Curiously, there is no way to
      say "everything" with question words. Instead, it is conventional to use other words like 「全部」. And
      although 「誰も」can sometimes be used to mean "everybody", it is customary to use 「皆」or 「皆さ
      ん」
    </p>
    <p>
      The remaining three words 「いつも」(meaning "always") and 「どれも」(meaning "any and all"), and
      「どこも」(meaning everywhere) can be used in both negative and positive sentences.

      (Grammatically, this 「も」is the same as the topic particle 「も」so the target particle 「に」must go
      before the topic particle 「も」in ordering.)

    <h2>
      Compound Sentences （から、ので、のに、が、けど、し、〜たりする）
    </h2>
    <p>
      In this section, we will learn various ways to combine multiple simple sentences into one complex sentence.
      For example, we will learn how to chain separate sentences together to express multiple actions
      or states. In other words, if we have two simple sentences with the same subject, "I ran" and "I ate",
      we will learn how to group them together to mean, "I ran and ate." We will also learn how to do this with
      adjectives and nouns. (Ex: He is rich, handsome, and charming.)
    </p>

      12. 直⼦【なお・こ】- Naoko (first name) <br>
      13. ちょっと- a little <br>

      15. そろそろ- gradually; soon <br>
      16. 失礼【しつ・れい】- discourtesy <br>
      17. する(exception) - to do <br>
      18. 学⽣【がく・せい】- student <br>

      22. とても- very <br>
      23. 穏やかだ【おだ・やかだ】 - calm, peaceful <br>
      24. 会う【あ・う】 - to meet
    </p>

    <p>
      You can connect two complete sentences using 「から」to indicate a reason for something. The two
      sentences are always ordered [reason] から[result]. When the reason is a non-conjugated noun or naadjective,
      you must add 「だ」to explicitly declare the reason in the form of 「(noun/na-adjective)だか
      ら」. If you forget to add the declarative 「だ」to 「から」, it will end up sounding like the 「から」
      meaning "from" which was first introduced in the section on particles, earlier.
    </p>

    <h3>Examples</h3>

    <p>
      1. 時間がなかったからパーティーに⾏きませんでした。 <br>
      There was no time so didn't go to party. <br> <br>
      
      2. 友達からプレゼントが来た。 <br>
      Present came from friend. <br> <br>

      3. 友達だからプレゼントが来た。 <br>
      Present came because (the person is) friend. (This sentence sounds a bit odd.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Either the reason or the result can be omitted if it is clear from the context. In the case of polite speech,
      you would treat 「から」just like a regular noun and add 「です」.
    </p>

    <h3>Example 1</h3>

    <p>
      ⽥中さん：どうしてパーティーに⾏きませんでしたか。 <br>
      Tanaka-san: Why didn't you go to the party? <br> <br>

      ⼭⽥さん：時間がなかったからです。 <br>
      Yamada-san: It's because I didn't have time.
    </p>

    <h3>Example 2</h3>

    <p>
      ⼀郎：パーティーに⾏かなかったの？ <br>
      Ichiro: You didn't go to the party? <br> <br>

      直⼦：うん、時間がなかったから。 <br>
      Naoko: Yeah, because I didn't have time.
    </p>

    <h3>Example 3</h3>

    <p>
      When you omit the reason, you must include the declarative 「だ」or 「です」.
    </p>
    <p>
      直⼦：時間がなかった。 <br>
      Naoko: I didn't have time. <br> <br>

      ⼀郎：だからパーティーに⾏かなかったの？ <br>
      Ichiro: Is that why you didn't go to the party?
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice that we could have also used the explanatory 「の」to express the same thing. In other words,
      ⼭⽥さんcould have also said, 「時間がなかったのです」or 「時間がなかったんです」while 直⼦
      could have said 「時間がなかったの」(we'll assume she wants to use the more feminine form). In fact,
      this is where 「ので」possibly came from. Let's say you want to combine two sentences: 「時間がな
      かったのだ」and 「パーティーに⾏かなかった」. Remember we can treat the 「の」just like a noun
      so we can use what we just learned in the first section of this lesson.
    </p>

    <p>
      時間がなかったのだ＋パーティーに⾏かなかった <br>
      becomes: <br>
      時間がなかったのでパーティーに⾏かなかった。 <br>
    </p>

    <p>
      In fact, 「ので」is almost interchangeable with 「から」with a few subtle differences. 「から」
      explicitly states that the sentence preceding is the reason for something while 「ので」is merely putting
      two sentences together, the first with an explanatory tone. This is something I call causation where [X]
      happened, therefore [Y] happened. This is slightly different from 「から」where [Y] happened explicitly
      because [X] happened. This difference tends to make 「ので」sound softer and slightly more polite and
      it is favored over「から」when explaining a reason for doing something that is considered discourteous.
    </p>

    <p>
      • ちょっと忙しいので、そろそろ失礼します。 <br>
      Because I'm a little busy, I'll be making my leave soon.
    </p>

    <p>
      (「失礼します」, which literally means "I'm doing a discourtesy", is commonly used as a polite way to
      make your leave or disturb someone's time.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Reminder: Don't forget that the explanatory 「の」requires a 「な」for both non-conjugated nouns
      and 形容動詞【けい・よう・どう・し】. Review Particles 3 to see why.
    </p>

    <p>
      1. 私は学⽣なので、お⾦がないんです。 <br>
      Because I'm a student, I have no money (lit: there is no money). <br> <br>

      2. ここは静かなので、とても穏やかです。 <br>
      It is very calm here because it is quiet. <br> <br>

      3. なので、友達に会う時間がない。 <br>
      That's why there's no time to meet friend.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just like how the explanatory 「の」can be shortened to 「ん」, in speech, the 「ので」can be
      changed to 「んで」simply because it's easier to slur the sounds together rather than pronouncing the
      / o / syllable.
    </p>

    <p>
      1. 時間がなかったんでパーティーに⾏かなかった。 <br>
      Didn't go to the party because there was no time. <br> <br>

      2. ここは静かなんで、とても穏やかです。 <br>
      It is very calm here because it is quiet. <br> <br>

      3. なんで、友達に会う時間がない。 <br>
      That's why there's no time to meet friend.

      3. する(exception) - to do <br>
      4. 全然【ぜん・ぜん】- not at all (when used with negative) <br>
      5. 痩せる【や・せる】 - to become thin <br>
      6. 学⽣【がく・せい】- student <br>
      7. 彼⼥【かの・じょ】- she; girlfriend <br>
      8. 勉強【べん・きょう】- study <br>
    </p>

    <p>
      Grammatically, 「のに」is used exactly the same way as 「ので」. When used to combine two simple
      sentences together, it means "[Sentence 1] despite the fact that [Sentence 2]." However the order is
      reversed: [Sentence 2]のに[Sentence 1].
    </p>

    <h3>Examples</h3>

    <p>
      1. 毎⽇運動したのに、全然痩せなかった。 <br>
      Despite exercising every day, I didn't get thinner. <br> <br>

      2. 学⽣なのに、彼⼥は勉強しない。 <br>
      Despite being a student, she does not study.

      3. 何【なに／なん】- what <br>
      4. 全然【ぜん・ぜん】- not at all (when used with negative) <br>

      13. 彼【かれ】- he; boyfriend <br>
      14. まだ- yet <br>

    </p>

    <p>
      Used in the same manner as 「から」and 「ので」, 「が」and 「けど」also connect two sentences
      together but this time to express a contradiction. Just like 「から」the declarative 「だ」is required for
      nouns and 形容動詞【けい・よう・どう・し】. And just like 「から」and 「ので」, either part of the contradiction can be left
      out.
    </p>

    <h3>Examples</h3>

    <p>
      1. デパートに⾏きましたが、何も欲しくなかったです。 <br>
      I went to department store but there was nothing I wanted. <br> <br>

      2. 友達に聞いたけど、知らなかった。 <br>
      I asked (or heard from) a friend but he (or I) didn't know. <br> <br>

      3. 今⽇は暇だけど、明⽇は忙しい。 <br>
      I'm free today but I will be busy tomorrow. <br> <br>

      4. だけど、彼がまだ好きなの。 <br>
      That may be so, but it is that I still like him. [explanation, feminine tone]
    </p>

    <p>
      It may seem odd but 「聞く」can either mean "to listen" or "to ask". You may think this may become
      confusing but the meaning is usually clear within context. In the second example, we're assuming that
      the friend didn't know, so the speaker was probably asking the friend. Yet again we see the importance
      of context in Japanese because this sentence can also mean, "I heard from a friend but I didn't know"
      since there is neither subject nor topic.
    </p>

    <p>
      Similar to the difference between 「から」and 「ので」, 「が」has a softer tone and is slightly more
      polite than 「けど」. Though this isn't a rule as such, it is generally common to see 「が」attached to a
      「〜ます」or 「〜です」ending and 「けど」attached to a regular, plain ending. A more formal version
      of 「けど」is 「けれど」and even more formal is 「けれども」, which we may see later when we cover
      formal expressions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unlike the English word for contradiction such as "but" or "however", 「けど」and 「が」do not
      always express a direct contradiction. Often times, especially when introducing a new topic, it is used
      as a general connector of two separate sentences. For example, in the following sentences, there is no
      actual contradiction but 「が」and 「けど」are used simply to connect the sentences. Sometimes, the
      English "and" becomes a closer translation than "but".
    </p>

    <p>
      1. デパートに⾏きましたが、いい物がたくさんありました。 <br>
      I went to the department store and there was a lot of good stuff. <br> <br>

      2. マトリックスを⾒たけど、⾯⽩かった。 <br>
      I watched the "Matrix" and it was interesting.
    </p>

    <h3>Expressing multiple reasons using 「し」</h3>
    <h3>Vocabulary</h3>

    <p>
      1. どうして- why <br>
      2. 友達【とも・だち】- friend <br>
      3. 先⽣【せん・せい】- teacher <br>
      4. 年上【とし・うえ】- older <br>
      5. 彼【かれ】- he; boyfriend <br>
      6. 好き【す・き】 - likable <br>
      7. 優しい【やさ・しい】 - gentle, kind <br>
      8. かっこいい - cool; handsome <br>
      9. ⾯⽩い【おも・し・ろい】 - interesting
    </p>

    <p>
      When you want to list reasons for multiple states or actions you can do so by adding 「し」to the end
      of each relative clause. It is very similar to the 「や」particle except that it lists reasons for verbs and
      state-of-being. Again, for states of being, 「だ」must be used to explicitly declare the state-of-being for
      any non-conjugated noun or na-adjective. Let's look at some examples.
    </p>

    <h3>Example 1</h3>

    <p>
      Ａ：どうして友達じゃないんですか？ <br>
      A: Why isn't (he/she) friend [seeking explanation]? <br> <br>

      Ｂ：先⽣だし、年上だし・・・。 <br>
      B: Well, he's/she's the teacher, and older...
    </p>

    <h3>Example 2</h3>

    <p>
      Ａ：どうして彼が好きなの？ <br>
      A: Why (do you) like him? <br> <br>

      Ｂ：優しいし、かっこいいし、⾯⽩いから。 <br>
      B: Because he's kind, attractive, and interesting (among other things).
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice that 「優しくて、かっこよくて、⾯⽩いから。」could also have worked but much like the
      difference between the 「と」and 「や」particle, 「し」implies that there may be other reasons.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Expressing multiple actions or states using 「〜たりする」
    </h3>
    <h3>Vocabulary</h3>

    <p>
      1. する(exception) - to do <br>
      2. ⾷べる【た・べる】 - to eat <br>
      3. 飲む【の・む】 - to drink <br>
      4. 簡単【かん・たん】 - simple <br>
      5. 難しい【むずか・しい】 - difficult <br>
      6. 映画【えい・が】- movie <br>
      7. ⾒る【み・る】 - to see <br>
      8. 本【ほん】- book <br>
      9. 読む【よ・む】 - to read <br>
      10. 昼寝【ひる・ね】- afternoon nap <br>
      11. この- this (abbr. of これの) <br>
      12. ⼤学【だい・がく】- college <br>
      13. 授業【じゅ・ぎょう】- class
    </p>

    <p>
      This is the verb version of the 「や」particle. You can make an example list of verbs among a possible
      larger list by conjugating each verb into the past tense and adding 「り」. At the end, you need to attach
      the verb 「する」. Just like the 「や」particle, the tense is determined by the last verb, which in this
      case will always be 「する」(since you have to attach it at the end).
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also use this with the state-of-being to say that you are a number of things at various random
      times among a larger list. Similar to regular verbs, you just take the noun or adjective for each state-ofbeing
      and conjugate it to the past state-of-being and then attach 「り」. Then finally, attach 「する」at
      the end.
    </p>

    <p>
      • For verbs: Conjugate each verb to the past tense and add 「り」. Finally, add 「する」at the
      very end.
    </p>
    <h3>Example</h3>

    <p>
      ⾷べる、飲む → ⾷べた、飲んだ → ⾷べたり、飲んだり → ⾷べたり、飲んだりする
      • For state-of-being: Conjugate the noun or adjective for each state-of-being to the past tense and
      add 「り」. Finally, add 「する」at the very end.
    </p>
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>
      簡単、難しい → 簡単だった、難しかった → 簡単だったり、難しかったり → 簡単だったり、難しかったりする
    </p>

    <p>
      1. 映画を⾒たり、本を読んだり、昼寝したりする。 <br>
      I do things like (among other things) watch movies, read books, and take naps. <br> <br>

      2. この⼤学の授業は簡単だったり、難しかったりする。 <br>
      Class of this college is sometimes easy, sometimes difficult (and other times something else maybe). 
    </p>
    <p>
      As you can see, the tense and negative/positive state is controlled by the last 「する」.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. 映画を⾒たり、本を読んだりした。 <br>
      I did things like (among other things) watch movies, and read books. <br> <br>

      2. 映画を⾒たり、本を読んだりしない。 <br>
      I don't do things like (among other things) watch movies, and read books. <br> <br>

      3. 映画を⾒たり、本を読んだりしなかった。 <br>
      I didn't do things like (among other things) watch movies, and read books.

    <h2>Uses of the て-form （〜ている、〜てある、〜ておく、〜ていく、〜てくる）</h2>
    <p>
      The て-form is incredibly useful as it is used widely in many different types of grammatical expressions.
      We will learn about enduring states with the 「〜ている」and 「〜てある」form. Even though we have
      learned various conjugations for verbs, they have all been one-time actions. We will now go over how
      one would say, for example, "I am running." We will also learn how to perform an action for the future
      using the 「〜ておく」expression and to express directions of actions using 「〜ていく」and 「〜て
      くる」.
    </p>

    <h3>Using 「〜ている」for enduring states</h3>
    <h3>Vocabulary</h3>

    <p>
      1. ⾷べる【た・べる】 - to eat <br>
      2. 読む【よ・む】 - to read <br>
      3. 友達【とも・だち】- friend <br>
      4. 何【なに】- what <br>
      5. する(exception) - to do <br>
      6. 昼ご飯【ひる・ご・はん】- lunch <br>
      7. 教科書【きょう・か・しょ】- textbook <br>
      8. 話【はなし】- story <br>
      9. 聞く【き・く】 - to ask; to listen <br>
      10. ううん- casual word for "no" (nah, uh-uh)
    </p>

    <p>
      We already know how to express a state-of-being using 「です」, 「だ」, etc. However, it only indicates
      a one-time thing; you are something or not. This grammar, however, describes a continuing state of an
      action verb. This usually translates to the progressive form in English except for a few exceptions, which
      we will examine later.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can make good use of the て-form we learned in the last section because the
      only thing left to do is add 「いる」! You can then treat the result as a regular 一段動詞【いち・だん・どう・し】.
      This 「いる」is the same 一段動詞【いち・だん・どう・し】 describing existence, first described in the negative verb section.
      However, in this case, you don't have to worry about whether the subject is animate or inanimate.
    </p>

    <p>
      To describe a continuing action, first conjugate the verb to the て-form and then attach the verb「い
      る」. The entire result conjugates as a 一段動詞【いち・だん・どう・し】.
    </p>

    <h3>Examples</h3>

    <p>
      1. ⾷べる → ⾷べて → ⾷べている <br>
      2. 読む → 読んで → 読んでいる
    </p>

    <p>
      The result conjugates as a 一段動詞【いち・だん・どう・し】 regardless of what the original verb is Positive Negative
    </p>
    <p>
      Non-Past : 読んでいる reading, 読んでいない is not reading <br>
      Past : 読んでいた was reading, 読んでいなかった was not reading
    </p>

    <h3>Using 「〜ている」for enduring states</h3>
    <h3>Example 1</h3>

    <p>
      Ａ：友達は何をしているの？ <br>
      A: What is friend doing? <br> <br>

      Ｂ：昼ご飯を⾷べている。 <br>
      B: (Friend) is eating lunch.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that once you've changed it into a regular 一段動詞【いち・だん・どう・し】, you can do all the normal conjugations. The
      examples below show the masu-form and plain negative conjugations.
    </p>

    <h3>Example 2</h3>

    <p>
      Ａ：何を読んでいる？ <br>
      A: What are you reading? <br> <br>

      Ｂ：教科書を読んでいます。 <br>
      B: I am reading textbook.
    </p>

    <h3>Example 3</h3>

    <p>
      Ａ：話を聞いていますか。 <br>
      A: Are you listening to me? (lit: Are you listening to story?) <br> <br>

      Ｂ：ううん、聞いていない。 <br>
      B: No, I'm not listening.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since people are usually too lazy to roll their tongues to properly pronounce the 「い」, it is often omitted
      in conversational Japanese. If you are writing an essay or paper, you should always include the 「い」.
      Here are the abbreviated versions of the previous examples.
    </p>

    <h3>Example 4</h3>

    <p>
      Ａ：友達は何をしてるの？ <br>
      A: What is friend doing? <br> <br>

      Ｂ：昼ご飯を⾷べてる。 <br>
      B: (Friend) is eating lunch.
    </p>

    <h3>Example 5</h3>

    <p>
      Ａ：何を読んでる？ <br>
      A: What are you reading? <br> <br>

      Ｂ：教科書を読んでいます。 <br>
      B: I am reading textbook.
    </p>

    <h3>Example 6</h3>

    <p>
      Ａ：話を聞いていますか。 <br>
      A: Are you listening to me? (lit: Are you listening to story?) <br> <br>

      Ｂ：ううん、聞いてない。 <br>
      B: No, I'm not listening.
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice how I left the 「い」alone for the polite forms. Though people certainly omit the 「い」even
      in polite form, you might want to get used to the proper way of saying things first before getting carried
      away with casual abbreviations. You will be amazed at the extensive types of abbreviations that exist in
      casual speech. (You may also be amazed at how long everything gets in super polite speech.) Basically,
      you will get the abbreviations if you just act lazy and slur everything together. Particles also get punted
      off left and right.
    </p>

    <h3>For example:</h3>

    <p>
      1. 何をしているの？(Those particles are such a pain to say all the time...) <br>
      2. 何しているの？(Ugh, I hate having to spell out all the vowels.) <br>
      3. 何してんの？(Ah, perfect.)
    </p>

    <h3>Enduring state-of-being vs enduring state of action</h3>
    <h3>Vocabulary</h3>

    <p>
      1. 知る【し・る】 - to know <br>
      2. 分かる【わ・かる】 - to understand <br>
      3. 今⽇【きょう】- today <br>
      4. この- this (abbr. of これの) <br>
      5. 歌【うた】- song <br>
      6. 道【みち】- road <br>
      7. はい- yes (polite)
    </p>

    <p>
      There are certain cases where an enduring state doesn't translate into the progressive form. In fact, there
      is an ambiguity in whether one is in a state of doing an action versus being in a state that resulted from
      some action. This is usually decided by context and common practices. For example, although 「結婚
      している」can technically mean someone is in a chapel currently getting married, it is usually used to
      refer to someone who is already married and is currently in that married state. We'll now discuss some
      common verbs that often cause this type of confusion for learners of Japanese.
    </p>

    <h3>「知る」</h3>

    <p>
      「知る」means "to know". English is weird in that "know" is supposed to be a verb but is actually
      describing a state of having knowledge. Japanese is more consistent and 「知る」is just a regular
      action verb. In other words, I "knowed" (action) something and so now I know it (state). That's why the
      English word "to know" is really a continuing state in Japanese, namely: 「知っている」.
    </p>

    <h3>「知る」vs 「分かる」</h3>

    <p>
      「分かる」meaning "to understand" may seem similar to 「知る」in some cases. However, there is a
      difference between "knowing" and "understanding". Try not to confuse 「知っている」with 「分かって
      いる」. 「分かっている」means that you are already in a state of understanding, in other words, you
      already get it. If you misuse this, you may sound pompous. ("Yeah, yeah, I got it already.") On the other
      hand, 「知っている」simply means you know something.
    </p>

    <h3>Examples</h3>

    <p>
      1. 今⽇、知りました。 <br>
      I found out about it today. (I did the action of knowing today.) <br> <br>

      2. この歌を知っていますか？ <br>
      Do (you) know this song? <br> <br>

      3. 道は分かりますか。 <br>
      Do you know the way? (lit: Do (you) understand the road?) <br> <br>

      4. はい、はい、分かった、分かった。 <br>
      Yes, yes, I got it, I got it.
    </p>

    <h3> Motion Verbs (⾏く、来る、etc.)</h3>

    <h3>Vocabulary</h3>
    <p>
      1. 鈴⽊【すず・き】- Suzuki (last name) <br>
      2. どこ- where <br>
      3. もう- already <br>
      4. 家【1) うち; 2) いえ】- 1) one's own home; 2) house <br>
      5. 帰る【かえ・る】 - to go home <br>
      6. 先【さき】- before <br>
      7. ⾏く【い・く】 - to go <br>
      8. 美恵【み・え】- Mie (first name) <br>
      9. 来る【く・る】(exception) - to come
    </p>

    <p>
      It is reasonable to assume the actions 「⾏っている」and 「来ている」would mean, "going" and
      "coming" respectively. But unfortunately, this is not the case. The 「〜ている」form of motion verbs is
      more like a sequence of actions we saw in the last section. You completed the motion, and now you exist
      in that state. (Remember, 「いる」is the verb of existence of animate objects.) It might help to think of
      it as two separate and successive actions: 「⾏って」、and then 「いる」.
    </p>

    <h3>Examples</h3>

    <p>
      1. 鈴⽊さんはどこですか。 <br>
      Where is Suzuki-san? <br> <br>

      2. もう、家に帰っている。 <br>
      He is already at home (went home and is there now). <br> <br>
      
      3. 先に⾏っているよ。 <br>
      I'll go on ahead. (I'll go and be there before you.) <br> <br>

      4. 美恵ちゃんは、もう来ているよ。 <br>
      Mie-chan is already here, you know. (She came and is here.)
    </p>

    <h3>Using 「〜てある」for resultant states</h3>

    <h3>Vocabulary</h3>

    <p>
      1. 準備【じゅん・び】- preparations <br>
      2. どう- how <br>
      3. もう- already <br>
      4. する(exception) - to do <br>
      5. ある - to exist (inanimate) <br>
      6. 旅⾏【りょ・こう】- travel <br>
      7. 計画【けい・かく】- plans <br>
      8. 終わる【お・わる】 - to end <br>
      9. うん- casual word for "yes" (yeah, uh-huh) <br>
      10. 切符【きっ・ぷ】- ticket <br>
      11. 買う【か・う】 - to buy <br>
      12. ホテル- hotel <br>
      13. 予約【よ・やく】- reservation
    </p>

    <p>
      Appropriately enough, just like there is an 「ある」to go with 「いる」, there is a 「〜てある」form
      that also has a special meaning. By replacing 「いる」with 「ある」, instead of a continuing action,
      it becomes a resultant state after the action has already taken place. Usually, this expression is used to
      explain that something is in a state of completion. The completed action also carries a nuance of being
      completed in preparation for something else.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since this grammar describes the state of a completed action, it is common to see the 「は」and 「も」
      particles instead of the 「を」particle.
    </p>

    <h3>Example 1</h3>

    <p>
      Ａ：準備はどうですか。 <br>
      A: How are the preparations? <br> <br>

      Ｂ：準備は、もうしてあるよ。 <br>
      B: The preparations are already done.
    </p>

    <h3>Example 2</h3>

    <p>
      Ａ：旅⾏の計画は終わった？ <br>
      A: Are the plans for the trip complete? <br> <br>

      Ｂ：うん、切符を買ったし、ホテルの予約もしてある。 <br>
      B: Uh huh, not only did I buy the ticket, I also took care of the hotel reservations.
    </p>

    <h3>Using the 「〜ておく」form as preparation for the future</h3>

      While 「〜てある」carries a nuance of a completed action in preparation for something else, 「〜てお
      く」explicitly states that the action is done (or will be done) with the future in mind. Imagine this: you
      have made a delicious pie and you're going to place it on the window sill for it to cool so that you can
      eat it later.

      This image might help explain why the verb 「おく」(置く), meaning "to place", can be
      used to describe a preparation for the future. (It's just too bad that pies on window sills always seem to
      go through some kind of mishap especially in cartoons.) While 「置く」by itself is written in kanji, it is
      customary to use hiragana when it comes attached to a conjugated verb (such as the て-form).

      「ておく」is also sometimes abbreviated to 「〜とく」for convenience.

    <p>
      You can also use the motion verbs "to go" (⾏く)and "to come" (来る) with the て-form, to show that an
      action is oriented toward or from someplace. The most common and useful example of this is the verb
      「持つ」(to hold). While「持っている」means you are in a state of holding something (in possession of),
      when the 「いる」is replaced with 「いく」or 「くる」, it means you are taking or bringing something.
      Of course, the conjugation is the same as the regular 「⾏く」and 「来る」.

    <h3>Examples</h3>

    <p>
      1. えんぴつを持っている？ <br>
      Do (you) have a pencil? <br> <br>

      2. 鉛筆を学校へ持っていく？ <br>
      Are (you) taking pencil to school? <br> <br>
      
      3. 鉛筆を家に持ってくる？ <br>
      Are (you) bringing pencil to home?
    </p>

    <p>
      For these examples, it may make more sense to think of them as a sequence of actions: hold and go, or
      hold and come. Here are a couple more examples.

    <p>
      1. お⽗さんは、早く帰ってきました。 <br>

      2. 駅の⽅へ⾛っていった。 <br>

    </p>

    <p>
      The motion verbs can also be used in time expressions to move forward or come up to the present.
    </p>

      1. 冬に⼊って、コートを着ている⼈が増えていきます。 <br>
